### Version 1.03 or above

Version 1.03 or above will have new option to set Animation Data by using animation clip so you will not have to set `Animation Action State`, `Animation Duration` and also not have to create new state in animator controller. Just set the `Animation Clip` and `Hit Duration Rate`

New Type field

`Hit Duration` will be deprecated, we will use `Hit Duration Rate` instead, you can get value of `Hit Duration Rate` from animation clip

We can preview animation clip to see when it should hit enemy, in this example it is 70%, so we’re going to set `Hit Duration Rate` to 0.7

For old users who have modifies Demo’s animator controller you have to

*   Add `DoAction` parameter as Bool
